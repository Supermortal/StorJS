			//Stor is intended to be a collection of data structures in javascript, but is currently only one structure: A multi-leafed (not binary) tree structure.
			//The intended usage of StorTree is for data coming back from REST services, i.e. arrays of arrays or arrays of objects that come directly from the database
			//through the service endpoint. StorTree can be used with several modes, which are demonstrated below, that give you some flexibility in how your data is stored
			//and organized.
		
			//Stor.Tree.Modes = {
				//StoreValues: { value: 0, name: "StoreValues", code: "SV" },
				//CreateAndStoreObjects: { value: 1, name: "CreateAndStoreObjects", code: "CASO" },
				//CreateObjects: { value: 2, name: "CreateObjects", code: "CO" },
				//CreateArrays: { value: 3, name: "CreateArrays", code: "CA" },
				//CartesianStoreValues: { value: 4, name: "CartesianStoreValues", code: "C-SV" },
				//CreateAndStoreArrays: { value: 5, name: "CreateAndStoreArrays", code: "CASA" }
			//};
			
			
			//StoreValues: { value: 0, name: "StoreValues", code: "SV" }
			//Store values is the most basic mode of the StorTree. It takes the indices or object keys (this mode and all modes can be used with both arrays of
			//arrays, or arrays of objects) you give to the constructor and creates a tree based on them. The order of the indices/keys put as parameters in the
			//constructor determine which key/index will be used for what depth.
			//An image for the tree created from the data below should be included in the images folder
