StorJS
======

A collection of JavaScript data structures.

Right now, Stor only has the StorTree.
The point of StorTree is to take data coming back from the server as an array of arrays or an array of objects,
and turn that data into a tree structure. There are several modes to choose from to accomplish this, and
I added a bunch of notes/examples to the index.html file.
